Hello and welcome to our project! This is a project for our Soft Eng class to produce a 
system for our campus's rec center. The idea was to make a system that can let customers register and browse their activities!

Java version:
This program was compiled on JDK 8 u202 (jdk1.8_202). We make no guarantees on other versions and have seen unexpected behavior in our testing on other versions!

How to run:
To run the program, you will need a database setup on your machine. Install postGRESQL 14.2.2 and make a BCRM database.
Then, simply restore the database with the db.sql file included here.

Then, you can either launch the program with the included batch file or navigate here with your choice of CLI and run
"BCRM.jar"
as a jar file (java -jar BCRM.jar)

That's it! Enjoy!
